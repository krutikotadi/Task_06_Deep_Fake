# Task 06 – Deep Fake Interview (Google Flow)

## Summary
This repo contains the supporting material for my Task 06 submission.  
I created a short “deep fake” interview using **Google Flow** based on the Seattle Sounders’ 3–0 victory over Inter Miami in the 2025 Leagues Cup Final.

## Files
- `interview_script.md` → the full script of the interview
- `flow_prompts.md` → the exact prompts I used in Google Flow
- `outputs/` → (contains the exported Flow video, or link below)

## Final Video
[Google Drive / YouTube link to the video]

## Notes
- Flow generated stock visuals and voices from my text prompts.
- I structured the project into 4–5 scenes: intro, interviewer questions, coach answers.
- Short, simple lines worked best for lip-sync and pacing.
